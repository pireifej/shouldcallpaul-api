            "desc": "<p>This presentation delves into the intricate process of migrating a large-scale fraud mitigation application from hundreds of on-premises servers to the cloud. Attendees will learn about the critical importance of cloud security, the use of cloud file share storage, and adherence to compliance standards. The talk will cover best practices for addressing code vulnerabilities, such as transitioning from hard-coded passwords to cloud variables and securely managing sensitive data files.</p><p>Additionally, the discussion will highlight how the cloud environment enhances fraud detection and prevention strategies, with a focus on maintaining pod status, ensuring effective production support, and achieving ease of maintenance. Join us to explore the journey towards a more secure, compliant, and efficient fraud mitigation infrastructure in the cloud, and how the cloud can bolster fraud mitigation efforts through advanced analytics and real-time monitoring.</p>",

As companies change or get larger, the need to integrate legacy applications into newer infrastructure becomes increasingly more important. When building out a roadmap for integration, issues to consider are user training, development planning, and testing & historical data migration. We will review a proven approach for working through a migration without jeopardizing functional, system or data integrity. Important points include training and working with super users for requirement gathering, technical hurdles to anticipate with integration & code reuse, testing in a reliable environment that reflects production quality data adequately and bridging the gap with migrating historical data and live data.</p>",

The more kinds of communication employed, the more effective they are.\" There are many reasons why large corporations choose to outsource a software development team, including cost savings, time savings, lack of inhouse experience and flexibility. There are many widely known strategies and documentations for making such a transition. However, what happens when you are forced to retire the outsourced development team and then reel that outsourced work back in? We recently went through this transition.</p>",
