    <h1>Interview with Lea DeLaria - Jazz and Comedy Icon</h1>
    
    <p>Lea DeLaria has been a cause célèbre since 1993 when she became the first out gay comic to be featured on late night television when she appeared on Arsenio Hall's show. Now a nationwide household name, though she's been a name in many of our households for the past 25 years and more, Lea is enjoying some well-earned and richly deserved renown. A gifted jazz singer with Broadway chops, DeLaria revolutionized the portrayal of Hildy Esterhazy in the 1998 Broadway revival of "On The Town" that Entertainment Weekly called "showstopping". It garnered her a Drama Desk nomination. She's also got an impressive discography including the February 2015 release of her latest work, "House of David delaria+bowie=jazz" on the presciently named Ghostlight Records.</p>


    <p class="interview-question">UT: Your role as Carrie "Big Boo" Black in the Netflix series "Orange is the New Black", for which you've won a Screen Actors Guild award, has put you on the map for many who don't know your career – do you believe that's because it's more difficult for women who choose to be comedians or because it's more difficult for women to be seen as the talents that they are?</p>
