    <p>When we first meet Sarah, mostly known as Squeak (Juliet Bratt), she is in a drunk tank lockup in a casino town on the Olympic Peninsula. Ingrid, mostly know as 'Grid (Tracie Lockwood), is an Amazon who stores like a buzz saw. Squeak speaks nearly auctioneer-quickly and she breaks the fourth wall as interlocutor to bring us in to a story that inspires a tinge of atavistic angst that lasts nearly two hours. This edgy inoculation is key to the storytelling and we realize we are on a different side of the law than where most of us reside.</p>

    <p>Gregg Henry's "Can't Run Can't Dance" with Lisa James' expert, direction is a tale of two buddies. Spoiler alert – unlike most XX chromosome buddy stories, this one doesn't end in death. Now that that's out of the way, this story is action-packed with a section or two that looks amazingly real (shout out to Brad Lemons' fight choreography). Hopes and dreams don't know gender and people all have them.</p>

    <p>Ronnie (John Stout Adams) is the Guy. He's got a connection with 'Grid that goes way back. Even though 'Grid's primary partner is Squeak, Ronnie is somehow the guy to whom she can't say "no". He's got a knack for picking the wrong horse, whether it's cards, scams or actual sport of kings and Squeak gets drawn into the scheme. If Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" was about a variation on the pursuit of the American Dream, so it Is here. 'Grid has Lennie's power and she and Squeak share George's brain. Ronnie's brother Ray (Zachary Grant) has got a project and he's not expecting some, or all, of what's in store for him. Act 2 is entirely in a cabin-in-the-woods – what could possibly go wrong?! Brazen, real and full of life – you must see this darkest of human comedies.</p>

        <p>New Jersey Repertory Company is famous for its World Premieres – and in many ways it is small wonder. This small wonder of a theater is like finding a piece of beautifully nuanced beach glass amongst a host of bits of shells and sand at the nearby Jersey Shore. Specializing in works that become treasures when they move to Broadway and Off-Broadway. Just look at their production list and you'll want to subscribe as well.</p>
