    <p>What's better than a weekend with NJ Symphony? A two-fer with NJS and Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey! An entire program of Romeo and Juliet, just in time for celebrating love or looking for a Valentine!</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p>How exciting that one of Shakespeare's most memorable, and most quotable, plays is of course the subject for the Romantic composers and Tchaikovsky is the Romantic king of the quotable melody! This program was without an intermission, yet it fell neatly into two acts thanks to two different works with very different treatments.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Act 1 was purely symphonic. Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture is rife with familiar melodies, lush and beautifully realized with swelling dynamics. Afterward NJS Music Director Xian Zhang fist-bumps Concert Master Eric Wyrick and Associate Concertmaster Brennan Sweet, it was THAT beautifully performed, and truly an overture to what was to come.</p>

    <p>After a brief changeover, Act 2 became a micro performance of Romeo and Juliet highlights, condensing nearly three hours of drama, tragedy and love to a 21st-century hour-long highlight featuring many favorite Shakespeare Theatre actors many of whom had just performed this very play in the Fall! Our Romeo and Juliet, Isaac Hickox-Yount and Billie Wyatt returned as our star-crossed lovers, Earl Baker was our Lord Montague, Jesmille Darbouze and David Shih our Lady and Lord Capulet, Alison Weller as the Nurse, Hassiem Muhammad as fiery Tybault, Dino Curia as Benvolio and Clark Carmichael as Mercutio and many of these actors doubled roles.</p>

    <p>They were everywhere - amongst the musicians, entering and leaving through the Prudential Theatre house and even coming from the boxes in the audience and the baffles nearly backstage, all illuminated from following Prokofiev's composition. There were sword fights, masked balls, street fights and poison and what more could one ask for in a sweeping heartfelt show about what love truly means.</p>

        <p><strong>What's next? If you're hungry for more, the Lunar New Year is nigh! Time to gallop for the Year of the Horse!</strong></p>
