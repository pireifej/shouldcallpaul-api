    <p>When we are young, we think we invented everything - feelings, deep love and (GASP!) sex. When we begin to gain more experience, we begin to see that the world moves in cycles of varying orbits and few knew this better than Shakespeare. Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey's production of the Bard's classic "Romeo and Juliet" under the masterful direction of Artistic Director Emerita Bonnie Monte ably demonstrates that there is still new territory for a centuries-old classic. Designing costumes and sound as well, Monte is in her 35th season with the company and her watchful eye reflects on everything. Casting real-life couple Billie Wyatt and Isaac Hickox-Young as the most tragic of lovers is pure magic. Why do a show that's been around for hundreds of years? Because a cast such as this comes along to breathe new life into this play we think we know. Sarah Beth Hall's Set Designs augmented by Andrew Hungerford's Lighting Design, spiced with Rod Kinter's Fight Direction makes this a lean, mean tragedy in five acts. Yup, and there is laughter and love, drama and angst and sword fights - it's Shakespeare, right?</p>

    <p>The social roles of men and women were very different from our times, yet people knew how to get what they needed and wanted, one way or another. Guile and wiles were the order of the day, and you see them both at work in this show. Fundamentally, communication is at the literal and figurative heart of love and feuds and when it misses, there are consequences.</p>

    <p>See this show for the chemistry between Juliet and her Romeo. See it for Quentin McCuiston's louche rapscallion of a Mercutio, the best I've ever seen – he's Romeo's bestie and you're bound to need bail money when you're out with M. See it for the scene where Juliet tells her parents Lord and Lady Capulet (Anthony Marble and Aurea Tomeski) and more that she's not marrying Paris and it feels like a Mozart quintet. Get your tickets, bring your friends and settle in for a brilliant evening of theatre but do it soon – this show is only happening until October 5, 2025.</p>

    <p>This season is already halfway through and there are still more violent delights to come. Visit <a href="https://ShakepeareNJ.org">ShakepeareNJ.org</a> now for the best selection.</p>
