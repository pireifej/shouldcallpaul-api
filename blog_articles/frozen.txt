    <p>What do you think when a friend takes her children to see "Frozen" for a preview and says "it's the best musical Paper Mill has ever done"? If you're like me, then my brain says "Oh, YEAH?" and the gauntlet is down. The truth of the matter is that Paper Mill Playhouse (PMP) has hit the ball out of the park. (Of course, I'm going to borrow a metaphor from their previous hit production of "Bull Durham".)</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p>First and foremost, when you consider the opportunity to give your family a truly wonderful experience this Holiday, don't "Let It Go"! This show is running now through January 11, 2026 and whether it's Chanukah, Christmas or Twelfth Night, Kwanzaa, Diwali or Solstice, make sure you get your tickets now.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This show has a familiar story told in a way that is truly magical to see. Huge kudos on casting, especially of Young Anna (Anjali Roa), Young Elsa (Hazel Vogel) and Anna (Samantha Williams). You'll want a moment to adjust to these voices, but give them a minute and you'll be hooked.</p>

    <p>The second act opens with "Hygge", a concept familiar to denizens of IKEA, yet brought to life by Oaken (Graham Stevens) in such a vivid way, you may find yourself wanting to get up with he and his family and dancing your way to the sauna among the other fauna. If you think "Frozen" is just for kids, you're missing out on more than half the fun! There are adult-oriented "Easter eggs" that will have your kids wondering what you find so funny. Pure joy for the entire family!</p>
