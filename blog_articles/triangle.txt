    <h1>The Brothers Size - Reverberating Truths</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Sherri Rase</p>
    
    
    <p>Tarell Alvin McCraney's play "The Brothers Size" was written back in 2007 when McCraney was in his third year as a student at Yale School of Drama. Though it was written nearly 10 years ago, it reverberates with that knell that resonates deep in the heart like the lowest thrumming notes of a pipe organ. So many overtones to that note and so deep it is almost below the human capacity to hear. But it is felt.</p>

    <p>Combining Yoruba mythology for whom his characters named with an all too familiar urban tale, we have two sets of brothers. Ogun (Brandon Carter) is the eldest brother Size who's always felt the weight of providing for and protecting his family. Their mother died when both boys were so very young and Oshoosi (Shamsuddin Abdul-Haid) ever since that time has always found himself on...</p>
