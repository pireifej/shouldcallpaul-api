Hoyt is Ralph, the octogenarian, whom we first meet sitting in a dog park, clearly waiting for someone.&nbsp; Hoyt’s Ralph is a sparky, sparkly gentleman of mature years, who comes from that Greatest Generation of Depression-era young adults, who did things because they were the right things to do.&nbsp; This will be an important point during the reveal of the plot twist in Act Two.&nbsp; It is highly likely that his antic good humor will remind you of an elder male relative of your own, born in a time when men and women had their sense of humor to get them through the toughest of times.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Rose is Ralph’s sister and she looks out for him.&nbsp; Noreen Farley’s Rose is brassy, street-wise and as plain-spoken and Hoboken as they come.&nbsp; She’s Archie Bunker in a frock and she’s got a—ahem—way with animals.&nbsp; She takes nothin’ from no one.&nbsp; Farley has an astonishing range in the characters she performs and it’s always a treat to see where she goes with the personalities she creates.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Ralph is waiting for Carol, played by Thea Ruth White with an elegance and reserve that many women lack today.&nbsp; She treats Ralph with a distant grace, slightly cool until she’s got enough information to get a read on him and that’s long enough for her to succumb to his charm.&nbsp; She’s a bit mysterious, and from the other side of the dog park – the more expensive side.&nbsp; Will they take a chance on meaning something to one another?</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Cory Singer is the character who gives us a glimpse, as the Young Man, into Ralph’s youthful psyche.&nbsp; This is not a spoiler: early on you learn that Ralph loves opera–the majesty and theatrical qualities of it are in his Italian blood.&nbsp; And this passion for life, not necessarily a carnal passion, illuminates his existence.&nbsp; The aptly named Singer gives us the sense of the youthful Ralph, who really has become the Ralph we know in “second youth” when Carol shines a light into the darkest recesses of his heart.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">I attended the performance at which Joe DiPietro, Director Eric Hafen, and the cast fielded questions from the audience about the show.&nbsp; Hafen discussed his choices of projected scenery and minimal sets.&nbsp; “The focus,” he said, “needs to be on the language and the characters.”&nbsp; “It’s about the families we make, whether people or animals” according to DiPietro, and the production is truly memorable.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">“The Last Romance” closes on October 13. &nbsp;Visit the Bickford box office now at the stately Morris Musem, or go online to &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bickfordtheatre.org/" style="border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 15px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(25, 130, 209); text-decoration-line: none;">www.bickfordtheatre.org&nbsp;</a>and get your tickets today! &nbsp;Take someone you love– romantically or family or both—and make memories you’ll cherish.</p>
