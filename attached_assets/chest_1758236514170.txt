It’s time to lead by example and stop looking outside for guidance when the answer is within.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">YOU have the power to make a difference. YOU have the power to make positive change.
