My father was my first influence, he was a jazz pianist as many people know. My first experiences were singing with his combo so I was always into jazz sounds.&nbsp; From my very early days, Ella Fitzgerald, Betty Carter and many others as singers were influences, but maybe even more were instrumentalists like Coltrane and Sonny Rollins.&nbsp; They probably influenced me more than singers.&nbsp; But I’ve always been a fan of jazz.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">UT:&nbsp; How soon after the Arsenio Hall gig did you begin acting?</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">LD: &nbsp;Less than a year after I appeared on Arsenio, there was a cameo written for me in the lesbian wedding episode of “Friends”.&nbsp; Same as they did for Candace Gingrich (who played the minister).&nbsp; I got to not only hit on Phoebe, part of my backstory was that I got her!&nbsp; Now when I first appeared on “Matlock”, that was different.&nbsp; A lot of directors were thinking “she’s a stand-up comedian, what does she know about acting”.&nbsp; I had to prove to them I could act.&nbsp; And when I did, my role as Detective Pat Jordan led to a return (as Detective Pat Poletti).&nbsp; Andy Griffith was a friend, and I think of him as a mentor as well. He taught me how to act for a television camera.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">UT:&nbsp; Your latest CD, House of David, was released in 2015.&nbsp; It’s ironic that the tribute you did while he was living has become a paean now that he’s passed.&nbsp; Did you hear from David directly regarding your interpretation of his work?</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">LD: David started following me on Twitter last February (2015) and his office contacted us and got a copy of the CD.

I haven’t had a day job since 1982. Most of the people who approach to say hello, or get an autograph are very polite.&nbsp; My fiancée coined the nickname for me “Bull Dyke Santa Claus” because when people just see me, they smile.&nbsp; But I never imagined this when I began.&nbsp; All I ever wanted to do was change the world.</p><p><br></p>
