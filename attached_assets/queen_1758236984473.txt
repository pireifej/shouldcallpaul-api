Bailey’s lights.&nbsp; Eason’s characters shine through Rhinehart and Coffman and while “Ethan Kane” sounds like an alter ego of some kind, his quirky spikey energy is an excellent contrast for “Olivia Lago”, whom some might interpret as “peaceful lake”.&nbsp; Consider, however, that still waters run deep and lakes have their own secrets as well.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Social media, print versus “soft” or electronic copies of books, cacophonies of reminder and notifications and what does it mean to reveal too much or too little of yourself in a world with a 15-second news cycle?&nbsp; These and other questions will surely spring to mind and you owe it to yourself to experience “Sex with Strangers” now.</p><p style="border: 0px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1.625em; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Share this show with someone you love to talk to – you’ll have plenty to say!
